## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library("data.table")
library("ggplot2")
library(scales)
library(Hmisc)

# comment these lines out if wd already local or not run from source()
thisdir <- getSrcDirectory(function(x) {
    x
})
setwd(thisdir)


# load, unzip data into data directory if needed
dir.create(file.path(".", "data"), showWarnings = FALSE)
data_filename = "data/data.zip"
if (!file.exists(data_filename)) {
    data_url <-
        "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
    download.file(data_url, destfile = data_filename)
    unzip("data/data.zip", exdir = "./data")
}
data_dir <- "./data"

activity <- fread(file.path(data_dir, "activity.csv"))
summary(activity)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

## Total Steps Per Day
```{r}
total_steps <- activity[, c(lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm=TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)]
total_steps

```

### Histogram of Steps Taken
```{r}
ggplot(total_steps, aes(x = steps)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 500) +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(title = "Total Steps Per Day", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency (Bin Width 500)")
```

### Median Steps Taken
```{r}
total_steps[, .(median_steps = median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))]
```

### Mean Steps Taken
```{r}
total_steps[, .(mean_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))]
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

### 1. Make a time series plot
```{r}
time_24hrs <- function(t) {
    t <- sprintf("%04d", t)
    t <- sprintf("%s:%s", substr(t, 0, 2), substr(t, 2, 3))
}
avg_steps_5min <- aggregate(
        x = list(mean_steps = activity$steps),
        by = list(interval = activity$interval),
        FUN = mean,
        na.rm = TRUE
    )
list_24hr <-
    sapply(activity$interval, function(time)
        sprintf("%04d", time))
list_24hr_ticks <- list_24hr[seq(1, length(list_24hr), 400)]
list_24hr_breaks <-
    activity$interval[seq(1, length(activity$interval), 400)]

head(activity$interval, 10)
head(list_24hr_ticks, 10)
ggplot(data = avg_steps_5min, aes(x = interval, y = mean_steps)) +
    geom_line() +
    theme_bw() +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = time_24hrs) +
    xlab("Time") +
    ylab("Average Steps Taken") 
```

### 2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
interval_max_steps <- which.max(avg_steps_5min$mean_steps)
max_steps = time_24hrs(avg_steps_5min[interval_max_steps, 'interval'])
max_steps
```

## Imputing missing values
### 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset.
```{r}
length(which(is.na(activity$steps)))
```

### 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r}
activity_imputed <- activity
activity_imputed$steps <- as.numeric(impute(activity_imputed$steps, fun=mean))
head(activity, 10)
head(activity_imputed, 10)
```

### 4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.
```{r}
total_steps_imputed <- activity_imputed[, c(lapply(.SD, sum)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)]
total_steps_imputed
ggplot(total_steps_imputed, aes(x = steps)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 500) +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(title = "Total Steps Per Day", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency (Bin Width 500)")
```

### 4.5 Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

### Median Steps Taken
```{r}
total_steps_imputed[, .(median_steps = median(steps))]
```

### Mean Steps Taken
```{r}
total_steps_imputed[, .(mean_steps = mean(steps))]
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

### 1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
activity[, day_type := as.POSIXct(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")]
activity[, day_type := weekdays(x=day_type)]
activity[grepl(pattern = "Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday", x=day_type), "day_type"] <- "Weekday"
activity[grepl(pattern = "Saturday|Sunday", x=day_type), "day_type"] <- "Weekend"
activity[, day_type := as.factor(day_type)]
head(activity, 10)
```

### 2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
activity_dt_interval <- activity[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval, day_type)]
ggplot(activity, aes(x = interval , y = steps, color=day_type))+
    geom_line() +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = time_24hrs) +
    xlab("Time") +
    ylab("Average Steps Taken") +
    labs(color = "Day Type") +
    facet_wrap(vars(day_type), ncol = 1, nrow = 2)
```
